# Syntax: xman_trfile SET1 SET2 FILE ...

# Given: Character SET1, character SET2, and a list of files/directories.
# Output: The list of files/directories which its characters in SET1 are translated into characters in SET2.

# Known problems/limitations:

# Example: 
# Translate all space in file names into '_'.
# > xman_trfile ' ' '_' file1 file\ 2
# The file "file\ 2" becomes "file_2".
# > xman_trfile ' ' '' file1 file\ 2
# The file "file\ 2" becomes file2.
