# Syntax: xman_dos2unix <FILE> ...

# Description: Apply dos2unix to all given ASCII files recursively.

# Given: Files or folders.
# Output: All ASCII files including those in subfolders (recursively) will have all CRLF being removed.

# Known problems/limitations:
# 1. $RANDOM might not be thread-safe. There might be a conflict in generating same RAND number. We should check whether the $TMP_DIR already exists.
